//Operator only Applicable for variable

// int a = 5;
// int b = 5++; its not working because we use the int value 


// Nexing incre/decre its not possible 

/* int a = 10;

int b = a++(++)    -- this is the nextin value*/

/*
   int price = 99;
   int final price = 99;  final means its the final so we cant modifiy
